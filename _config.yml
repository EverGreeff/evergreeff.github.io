  I'm a full-stack developer with a strong focus on building custom software solutions tailored to real-world business needs. Over the years, I’ve developed complete systems from scratch — from backend logic and database design to responsive UIs and client-facing features.
  <br>
  🔧 Technologies I often work with:
  C#, .NET, WinForms, SQLite, PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, Flutter, and WebSocket servers.
  <br>
  💡 What sets me apart:
  I'm highly adaptable — I regularly dive into new languages, frameworks, and platforms based on project needs. Whether it’s integrating barcode scanners in a desktop app, setting up real-time communication with WebSockets, or building full web systems from scratch — I thrive on learning and delivering.
