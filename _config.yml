   I'm a full-stack developer with a strong focus on building custom software solutions tailored to real-world business needs. Over the years, Iâ€™ve developed complete systems from scratch â€” from backend logic and database design to responsive UIs and client-facing features. 
   <br>
   Iâ€™m passionate about solving complex problems with clean, maintainable code. Iâ€™ve worked closely with clients across industries, especially in scenarios where reliability and precision matter â€” like mining operations, equipment tracking, and internal control systems.
   <br><br>
   ðŸ”§ Technologies I often work with:
   C#, .NET, WinForms, WPF, SQLite, PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, Flutter, and WebSocket servers. 
   <br><br>
   ðŸ’¡ What sets me apart:
   I'm highly adaptable â€” I regularly dive into new languages, frameworks, and platforms based on project needs. Whether itâ€™s integrating barcode scanners in a desktop app, setting up real-time communication with WebSockets, or building full web systems from scratch â€” I thrive on learning and delivering.
