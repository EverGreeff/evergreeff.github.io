   I'm a full-stack developer with a strong focus on building custom software solutions tailored to real-world business needs. Over the years, I’ve developed complete systems from scratch — from backend logic and database design to responsive UIs and client-facing features. 
   <br>
   I’m passionate about solving complex problems with clean, maintainable code. I’ve worked closely with clients across industries, especially in scenarios where reliability and precision matter — like mining operations, equipment tracking, and internal control systems.
   <br><br>
   Technologies I often work with:
   C#, .NET, WinForms, WPF, SQLite, PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, Flutter, and WebSocket servers. 
   <br><br>
   What sets me apart:
   I'm highly adaptable — I regularly dive into new languages, frameworks, and platforms based on project needs. Whether it’s integrating barcode scanners in a desktop app, setting up real-time communication with WebSockets, or building full web systems from scratch — I thrive on learning and delivering.
